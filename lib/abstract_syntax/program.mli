(* An f-function (also called "indifferent") is a function that just unfolds to its body;
   a g-function (called "curious") is a function that pattern-matches on its first
   parameter and has several unfolding rules for each pattern alternative. This is a
   standard terminology in the supercompilation literature, which was originally
   introduced for SLL (Simply Lazy Language). *)
